Is there a way to force Periscope to broadcast in landscape mode? Watching portrait mode video is annoying.

Sorry but this is a burden you are forced to bear. The only alternative is an intervention – if the broadcast is live use the comments ask the person broadcasting to film in landscape. If the broadcast is filmed in landscape you’ll then be stuck with that instead.
